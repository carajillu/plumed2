1. DEPENDENCIES
   GHOSTPROBE relies on the use of the armadillo library (https://arma.sourceforge.net/), which
   in turn relies on blas and lapack. PLUMED has its own internal blas and lapack, but for best
   performance, either openblas or intel-mkl are recommended. This installation instructions use
   intel-mkl. To install the required libraries, run the following in the specified order:

   sudo apt install intel-mkl # when prompted, accept that blas and lapack point to intel-mkl
   sudo apt install librarmadillo-dev

2. INSTALLATION
   To install the plumed version that contains GHOSTPROBE, run the following commands in the plumed2_carajillu
   directory:

   ./configure --prefix=/home/carajillu/local/plumed2 LIBS='-larmadillo'
   make install # may add the -j option to speed up the installation. Tested with -j8.

3. PERFORMANCE
   This setup gives a performance of ~100 ns/day using the system in the test folder on 
   an ASUS ROG G14 2021 Edition (RXT3060 Laptop GPU + AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS). Using Gromacs
   2021.4 on Ubuntu 20.04 emulator for WSL. Comparatively low performnance may be due to
   not linking libraries correctly.
