1. DEPENDENCIES
   GHOSTPROBE relies on the use of the armadillo library, which
   in turn relies on blas and lapack. PLUMED has its own internal blas and lapack, but for best
   performance, either openblas or intel-mkl are recommended. This installation instructions use
   intel-mkl. Instructions to install the requyired libraries can be found here:
   - intel-mkl: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/installing-free-libraries-and-python-apt-repo.html
   - armadillo: https://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html
   
   The setup and analysis scripts rely on the use of the following python modules:
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - mdtraj
   - pymp
   - pickle

2. INSTALLATION
   To install the plumed version that contains GHOSTPROBE, run the following commands in the plumed2_carajillu
   directory:

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/directory/plumed2 LIBS='-larmadillo'
   make install # may add the -j option to speed up the installation. Tested with -j8.
   
   Once the installation is finshed, you need to add this to your ~/.bashrc file:
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/directory/plumed2/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export PLUMED_KERNEL=/home/jcn/local/plumed2/lib/libplumedKernel.so
   
   To patch your MD engine with plumed, follow the instructions here:

3. PERFORMANCE
   This setup gives a performance of ~100 ns/day using the system in the test folder on 
   an ASUS ROG G14 2021 Edition (RXT3060 Laptop GPU + AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS). Using Gromacs
   2021.4 on Ubuntu 20.04 emulator for WSL. Comparatively low performnance may be due to
   not linking libraries correctly.
