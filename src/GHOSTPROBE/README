DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE GHOSTPROBE COLLECTIVE VARIABLE
GhostProbe is a CV that induces the opening of cryptic pockets

DEPENDENCIES
Armadillo (currently 12.6.4)
An MPI-capable compiler if you want to use MPI

(For other dependencies, see main plumed installation instructions)

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (run from plumed2_carajillu/ directory)

1) DEPENDENCIES
   Assuming you have a working C/C++ compiler which supports MPI (if you want it)
   1.a) For a quick and dirty (and slow execution) installation of dependencies (uses anaconda):
        conda env create -f plumed2_carajillu.yml
        conda activate plumed2_carajillu
   1.b) For a 10x faster execution of the derivatives correction, the BLAS version
        included in the intel-mkl package is recommended. Run the following commands:
        sudo apt install intel-mkl
        sudo apt install libarmadillo-dev
        
2) If you already have all the relevant compilers and libraries:

./configure --prefix="path/to/where/plumed/will/be/installed" LIBS="-larmadillo" CXX=$YOUR_MPI_COMPILER #if you want MPI
make install

3) Add the following directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:path/to/where/plumed/will/be/installed/lib
4) Set this environment variable: PLUMED_KERNEL=path/to/where/plumed/will/be/installed/lib/libplumedKernel.so


RUNNING PLUMED WITH GROMACS 2021.4

Later versions of gromacs (at least 2023) don't support plumed when the "update -gpu" option is on, so for the moment we run on 2021.4 which is the last one that worked. To install that version of gromacs, you need:
- CUDA Toolkit 11.3
- gcc-10
sudo apt install cuda-11-3 gcc-10 g++-10
